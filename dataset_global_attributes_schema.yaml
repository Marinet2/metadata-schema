title: # Title of dataset to be inserted here
summary: # Short summary of dataset

keywords: # keywords that further explains dataset provided as list: ['keyword 1', 'keyword 2', ..., 'keyword N']
          # keywords ideally should be sources from an established/community-driven vocabulary of terms
          # alternatively instead of keywords you could provide resolvable URIs of keywords, e.g. :
          # instead of writing 'wind direction', one can provide URI instead http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P09/current/WDIR/
keywords_vocabulary: # when some or all keywords are sources from restricted vocabularies provide a list of
                     # URI's to the restricted vocabularies from where the keywords are sourced.
                     # e.g.: ['http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/71/build/cf-standard-name-table.html', 'http://data.windenergy.dtu.dk/taxonomy/', 'http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P09/current/']

dataset_id: # unique and persistent identifier of dataset, e.g. DOI
dataset_id_authority: # an URI of the authority body that generated dataset_id

infrastructure_id: # a list of PIDs or URIs (in the worst case infrastructure names) to virtual (models, HPC) or physical (instruments) infrastructure(s) which generated dataset
site: # location where data was created, this is mandatory only for measurements datasets otherwise it can be dropped

creator_name: # an ordered list of FirstName LastName of those whose created the dataset (order according to the level of contributions)
creator_email: # a list of creators' email addresses which follows the order of creator_name
creator_id: # a list of creators' ORCID IDs which follows the order of creator_name, if IDs are missing input empty string
creator_role: # a list of list of roles creators (which follows the order of creator_name list) had in the dataset creation
              # roles are described by CredIT taxonomy: https://like-itn-digitalization.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_research_lifecycle/#roles-in-lifecycle

contributor_name: # an ordered list of FirstName LastName of those whose contributor to the creation of dataset (order according to the level of contributions)
contributor_email: # an ordered list of contributor email addresses
contributor_id: # an order list of contributor ORCID IDs, if IDs are missing input empty string
contributor_role: # a list of list of roles contributors (which follows the order of creator_name list) had in the dataset creation
                  # roles are described by CredIT taxonomy: https://like-itn-digitalization.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_research_lifecycle/#roles-in-lifecycle

project_name: # a list of projects which provided funding for the dataset generation
project_id: # a list of project numbers which are identifiable in for example OpenAIER
            # this list is ordered according project_name metadata
project_url: # an ordered list of projects' landing pages


data_mode : # This attribute can take one of following values: "Raw", "Provisional", "Delayed-mode" or "Mixed", where:
            # Raw represents unprocessed data.
            # Provisional data means that some calibrations or editing on data may have been done, but the data is not thought to be fully processed. Refer to the history attribute for more detailed information.
            # Delayed-mode data represents data published after all calibrations and quality control procedures have been applied on the internally recorded or best available original data. This is the best possible version of processed data.
            # Mixed data indicates that the dataset contains data in more than one of the above states.
