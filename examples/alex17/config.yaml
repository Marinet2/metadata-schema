# To identify dataset you need to provide a unique & persistent identifier(PID).
# The most obvious candidate for dataset PID is DOI.
# A way to obtain it prior publishing your dataset is to make a DOI reservation.
# Then simply insert the reserved DOI here.
# PIDs should be resolvable.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID
dataset_id: ''

# An URI of the authority body that generated dataset_id
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable URI
dataset_id_authority: ''

# If dataset is a part of larger data collection is_part_of provides the
# link to the collection. For example, data collection will have PID, such as
# DOI. Therefore, is_part_of will contain that PID.
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID
is_part_of: ''

# If the entire dataset is split to multiple files into multiple files
# is_related_to holds ids of remaining files which make dataset complete.
# The ids of remaining files could be simple as file names.
# Attribute: mandatory (if dataset is split to multiple files)
# Input type: fixed resolvable PIDs
is_related_to: ['']

# Dataset is generated wither using virtual (models) or physical(instruments)
# infrastructures. Accordingly, it is always a good practice to indicate
# what infrastructure was used to generate the dataset.
# infrastructure_id should contain a list of ids of the used infrastructures.
# The ids could be for example URLs to the instruments.
# Attribute: optional
# Input type: free text or fixed resolvable URIs/PIDs
infrastructure_id: ['']


# Provide a list of people who take a part in data creation.
# List them according to the priority as FirstName LastName.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: free text
creator_name: ['Gancarski, Pawe≈Ç']

# Provide a list of emails of data creators. The list elements must follow
# the order of creators' names.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: free text
creator_email: ['pgancarski@cener.com']

# Since people to tend to change their positions or jobs email addresses tend
# to be obsolete. To maintain a possibility of contacts a much more persistent
# approach is to provide ORCiD ids of creators.
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID
creator_id: ['https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9198-8429']

# List of creator names don't tell us much about who done what in the process
# of data creation. creator_role provides a means to highlight a particular
# role(s) each data creator had. The roles could be described using CredIT
# taxonomy:

# Provide a list of people who contributed to data creation, but where not
# sufficient contributors to be seen as data creators.
# List them according to the priority as FirstName LastName.
