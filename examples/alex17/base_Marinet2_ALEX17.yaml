title: 'Submission to ALEX17 Diurnal Cycles Benchmark'

summary: 'Submission to the ALEX17 Diurnal Cycles Benchmark - a large domain in complex terrain. https://thewindvaneblog.com/alex17-diurnal-cycles-benchmark-a-large-domain-in-complex-terrain-b5029e94485'

# Dataset keywords are similar like journal paper keywords. They highlight
# particularities of the given dataset. Ideally keywords should be sourced
# from control vocabularies which are used by communities.
# Keywords should be provided as a list.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: free text or terms from controlled vocabulary
keywords: ['Meteorological','Flow','Modeling','Onshore','Complex','Forest','Rural','wind speed']


# If some or all keywords are sourced from controlled vocabularies it is a good
# practice to provide a list of the controlled vocabulary URI's from where the
# keywords are sourced from. One example is taxonomy of wind energy topics:
# 'http://data.windenergy.dtu.dk/taxonomy/'
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable URIs
keywords_vocabulary: ['http://data.windenergy.dtu.dk/taxonomy/']

# To identify dataset you need to provide a unique & persistent identifier(PID).
# The most obvious candidate for dataset PID is DOI.
# A way to obtain it prior publishing your dataset is to make a DOI reservation.
# Then simply insert the reserved DOI here.
# PIDs should be resolvable.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID
dataset_id: ''

# An URI of the authority body that generated dataset_id
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable URI
dataset_id_authority: ''

# If dataset is a part of larger data collection is_part_of provides the
# link to the collection. For example, data collection will have PID, such as
# DOI. Therefore, is_part_of will contain that PID.
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID
is_part_of: ''

# If the entire dataset is split to multiple files into multiple files
# is_related_to holds ids of remaining files which make dataset complete.
# The ids of remaining files could be simple as file names.
# Attribute: mandatory (if dataset is split to multiple files)
# Input type: fixed resolvable PIDs
is_related_to: ['']

# Dataset is generated wither using virtual (models) or physical(instruments)
# infrastructures. Accordingly, it is always a good practice to indicate
# what infrastructure was used to generate the dataset.
# infrastructure_id should contain a list of ids of the used infrastructures.
# The ids could be for example URLs to the instruments.
# Attribute: optional
# Input type: free text or fixed resolvable URIs/PIDs
infrastructure_id: ['']


# A location, thus site, where data was created.
# Attribute: mandatory (only for measurements datasets)
# Input type: free text
site: 'Alaiz'

# Provide a list of people who take a part in data creation.
# List them according to the priority as FirstName LastName.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: free text
creator_name: ['']

# Provide a list of emails of data creators. The list elements must follow
# the order of creators' names.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: free text
creator_email: ['']

# Since people to tend to change their positions or jobs email addresses tend
# to be obsolete. To maintain a possibility of contacts a much more persistent
# approach is to provide ORCiD ids of creators.
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID
creator_id: ['']

# List of creator names don't tell us much about who done what in the process
# of data creation. creator_role provides a means to highlight a particular
# role(s) each data creator had. The roles could be described using CredIT
# taxonomy:
# https://like-itn-digitalization.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_research_lifecycle/#roles-in-lifecycle
# Attribute: optional
# Input type: free text or terms from controlled vocabulary
creator_role: ['']


# Provide a list of people who contributed to data creation, but where not
# sufficient contributors to be seen as data creators.
# List them according to the priority as FirstName LastName.

# It is important to help users understand in what state data are. This is
# explicitly stated in data_mode. The data_mode takes terms from controlled
# vocabulary ["Raw", "Provisional", "Delayed-mode", "Mixed"] where:
# - Raw represents unprocessed data
#
# - Provisional data means that some calibrations or editing on data may
#   have been done, but the data is not thought to be fully processed.
#   Refer to the history attribute for more detailed information.
#
# - Delayed-mode data represents data published after all calibrations and
#   quality control procedures have been applied on the internally recorded or
#   best available original data. This is the best possible version of
#   processed data.
#
# - Mixed data indicates that the dataset contains data in more than
#   one of the above states.
#
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: term from controlled vocabulary
