# A dataset should have a concise title. Follow the same approach like in
# giving titles to journal articles.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: free text
title: 'insert_title'

# A dataset should have a descriptive summary allowing users to understand
# better what the dataset is about and for what it can be used for.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: free text
summary: 'insert_summary'

# Dataset keywords are similar like journal paper keywords. They highlight
# particularities of the given dataset. Ideally keywords should be sourced
# from control vocabularies which are used by communities.
# Keywords should be provided as a list.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: free text or terms from controlled vocabulary
keywords: ['insert_keyword_1','insert_keyword_2']


# If some or all keywords are sourced from controlled vocabularies it is a good
# practice to provide a list of the controlled vocabulary URI's from where the
# keywords are sourced from. One example is taxonomy of wind energy topics:
# 'http://data.windenergy.dtu.dk/taxonomy/'
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable URIs
keywords_vocabulary: ['insert_vocab_URI_1','insert_vocab_URI_2']

# To identify dataset you need to provide a unique & persistent identifier(PID).
# The most obvious candidate for dataset PID is DOI.
# A way to obtain it prior publishing your dataset is to make a DOI reservation.
# Then simply insert the reserved DOI here.
# PIDs should be resolvable.
# Attribute: mandatory
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID
dataset_id: 'insert_PID'

# An URI of the authority body that generated dataset_id
# Attribute: recommended

# If dataset is a part of larger data collection is_part_of provides the
# link to the collection. For example, data collection will have PID, such as
# DOI. Therefore, is_part_of will contain that PID.
# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID
is_part_of: 'insert_data_collection_PID'

# If the entire dataset is split to multiple files into multiple files
# is_related_to holds ids of remaining files which make dataset complete.

# Attribute: optional
# Input type: free text or fixed resolvable URIs/PIDs

# Attribute: recommended
# Input type: fixed resolvable PID

# It is important to help users understand in what state data are. This is
# explicitly stated in data_mode. The data_mode takes terms from controlled
# vocabulary ["Raw", "Provisional", "Delayed-mode", "Mixed"] where:
# - Raw represents unprocessed data
#
# - Provisional data means that some calibrations or editing on data may
#   have been done, but the data is not thought to be fully processed.
#   Refer to the history attribute for more detailed information.
#
# - Delayed-mode data represents data published after all calibrations and
#   quality control procedures have been applied on the internally recorded or
#   best available original data. This is the best possible version of
#   processed data.
#
# - Mixed data indicates that the dataset contains data in more than
#   one of the above states.
