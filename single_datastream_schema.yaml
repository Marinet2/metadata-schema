## Discovery and identification ##
##################################
short_name: # Short name of variable
standard_name: # Variable/data stream standard name, see CF convention table for standard_name
long_name: # Long name of variable
alt_name: # List of alternative names of variables from known vocabularies.
          # This should boost data re-use by broader community.
concept_id: # Id of concept (i.e., variable) which will be used to link it to the web-hosted vocabularies
concept_URI: # Link to the concept definition (i.e., a link to a web-hosted vocabulary)

## Values and units ##
######################
dtype: # Type of data stored in the variables (e.g., int, float or double)
units: # Variable units
valid_min: # Minimum allowed value
valid_max: # Maximum allowed value
valid_range: # Range expressed as [valid_min, valid_max] when variable is continuous
allowed_values: # List of specific values that the variable can take in case it is discreet
uncertainty: # Uncertainty of variable values
_FillValue: # Fill values must be chosen according to the variable data type (int, float, double)
            # typically it is set to NaN considering that the majority of our variables are floats
add_offset: # Offset value to be added to all the values of the variable.
            # This is used to save space by switching from float to int
scale_factor: # Scaling value to be multiplied to all the values of the variable
              # This is used to save space by switching from float to int
compression_level: # Level of compression of variables
compression_type:  # Compression type

######################
## Misc information ##
######################
ancillary_variables: # short_name of the flag channel for the variable.
                     # The list of all related QC variables must be indicated.
related_variables: # List of related variables in the dataset, provided as short_name(s)
